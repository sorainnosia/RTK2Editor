# RTK2Editor

A software to hack saved file of game Romance of Three Kingdom 2.

First copy the saved game file into the folder where the exe is, run the program and type the filename of the saved game, click Load.

Input the name of General into Reinforce to make them have max stats separated by enter (one line for one general) and input province number into Prosperity in order to make the country has max food/wealth (one line one number of the province).

Input the name of General into Ruin Army to make their army force to 0 separated by enter (one line for one general).

Click Save.

Copy the modified saved game into the RTK2 folder and load the saved game file and you will see new stats.

This is an old game where I played during kid, so this repository might not be relevant anymore.
